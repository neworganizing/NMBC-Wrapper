# New Organizing Institute New Media Bootcamp Wrapper

This repository contains the basic New Media Bootcamp website and email wrapper used by the [New Organizing Institute](http://neworganizing.com) alongside other training organizations who teach New Media best practices.

It is vital that this template is **easy to modify by inexperienced web developers** and **easy to understand with limited explanation**

This wrapper is originally designed to work with [BSDTools](http://bsdtools.com) and as such includes relevant fields used by BSDTools (such as unsubscribe links.) Feel free to adapt this to work with other CRMs, but it is vital that this template is "plug and play" with BSDTools.
